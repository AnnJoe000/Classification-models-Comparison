1️⃣ Confusion Matrices:
      Displayed for each model to show the distribution of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
      This helped in understanding where the models made correct and incorrect predictions.
2️⃣ Accuracy Comparison Bar Plot:
      A bar plot to compare the accuracy scores of the five classification models.
      Provided a clear view of which models performed better in terms of accuracy.
3️⃣ Classification Report Visualization:
      Plotted the weighted average precision, recall, and f1-scores for all models to visually assess their performance.
      The bar plot visualization made it easy to identify the top-performing model.
4️⃣ Heatmap for Correlation:
      Displayed the correlation between features of the dataset.
      Helped in identifying relationships between features, which can inform feature selection and interpretation.


Impact of Visualizations
    The visualizations made it easier to interpret the models' performance and provided a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics.
    The plots for classification reports and accuracy were particularly effective in demonstrating why Random Forest was the best model and why k-NN struggled.
